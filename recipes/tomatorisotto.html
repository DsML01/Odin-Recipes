 <h4>Creamy tomato risotto</h4>
 <p>A budget rice dish flavoured with rosemary, basil and sweet cherry tomatoes. It's healthy, filling and simple to make â€“ an ideal midweek supper </p>
 <h4>ingredients</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>400g can chopped tomato</li>
  <li>1l vegetable stock</li>
  <li>knob of butter</li>
  <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
  <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 rosemary sprig, finely chopped</li>
  <li>250g risotto rice</li>
  <li>300g cherry tomato, halved</li>
  <li>small pack basil, roughly torn</li>
  <li>4 tbsp grated parmesan</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Now, follow these steps</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Tip the chopped tomatoes and half the stock into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Pour into a saucepan with the remaining stock, bring to a gentle simmer and keep over a low heat.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, place the butter and oil in the base of a large saucepan and heat gently until the butter has melted. Add the onion and gently cook for 6-8 mins until softened. Stir in the garlic and rosemary, then cook for 1 min more. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 min.</li>
  <li>Start adding the hot stock and tomato mixture about a quarter at a time. Let the risotto cook, stirring often, adding more stock as it is absorbed. After you have added half the stock, add the cherry tomatoes. After 20-25 mins, the rice should be creamy and tender, the cherry tomatoes softened and all of the stock should be used up.</li>
  <li>Cover and leave for 1 min, then stir in the basil. Serve sprinkled with Parmesan and a good grinding of black pepper.</li>
