 <h4>Brazilian toasted cassava flour</h4>
 <p>Farofa is a traditional Brazilian side dish made with toasted yuca flour/cassava flour, or how we call it in Portuguese "farinha de mandioca". This dish is mainly eaten in Brazil and it's normally available in Brazilian restaurants all over the world. </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Cassava flour</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Onions</li>
  <li>Garlic</li>
  <li>Parsley</li>
  <li>Chives</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Now, follow these steps</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>In a cold skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until golden brown. The reason for that is because you need to render the bacon fat before frying it.</li>
  <li>Once the fat is rendered, add the butter and cook the bacon until golden brown.</li>
  <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté them until transparent. The onions need to be finely chopped so that they flavor the farofa rather than competing in texture with it</li>
  <li>Next, add the garlic and sauté it for a minute</li>
  <li>Add the cassava flour and stir continuously to avoid letting it burn.</li>
  <li>once the farofa is nicely and evenly toasted, remove it from the heat. It shouldn’t take more than 5 minutes after adding the cassava flour.</li>
  <li>Now, add the parsley and chives and mix well the ingredients.</li>
  <li>And finally, put your farofa on a serving plate and bom apetite!</li>
</ol>
