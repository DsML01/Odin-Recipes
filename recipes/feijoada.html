 <h4>Feijoada (Brazilian Black Bean Stew)</h4>
 <p>Brazilian Feijoada is a black bean and pork stew that Brazilians often serve topped with <a href="farofa.html">farofa</a>, toasted cassava flour. Many call this comfort food the national dish of Brazil.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>1 pound (450g) dry black beans</li>
  <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 pound (450g) pork shoulder</li>
  <li>2 large onions, sliced</li>
  <li>1 head garlic, peeled and chopped</li>
  <li>1 pound (450g) carne seca or corned beef, cut into chunks</li>
  <li>1/2 pound (225g) fresh sausages, such as chorizo or Italian sausage</li>
  <li>1 pound (450g) smoked sausage, such as linguica or kielbasa</li>
  <li>1 smoked ham hock or shank</li>
  <li>3 to 4 bay leaves</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 14.5 ounce can (411g) crushed tomatoes</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Now, follow these steps</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Soak the beans in hot water:
    Pour boiling water over the black beans and let them sit while you prepare the rest of the stew.</li>
  <li>Brown the pork shoulder:
    Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and brown the pork shoulder. When the meat has browned, remove the meat from the pot, set aside.</li>
  <li>Brown the onions and add garlic:
    Add the onions to the pot. Brown them, stirring occasionally, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.
    
    Sprinkle a little salt over the onions and add the garlic. Stir well and sauté 2 more minutes.</li>
  <li>Add the meat, bay leaves, and water:
    Add back the pork shoulder and the other meats. Add enough water to cover all ingredients. Add the bay leaves, cover, and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Add the soaked black beans:
    Drain the black beans from their soaking liquid and add them to the stew. Simmer gently, covered, until the beans are tender, about an hour and a half.</li>
  <li>Add the tomatoes:
    Add the tomatoes, stir well and taste for salt, adding if it's needed. Simmer this, uncovered, until the meat begins to fall off the ham hock, which will probably take 2 to 3 hours.
    
    Serve with white rice and hot sauce. A classic side dish would be sautéed collard greens.</li>
    <li>And now, enjoy!</li>
