 <h4>Bread and butter pizza</h4>
 <p>This pizza has the perfect textural contrast between the flavorful, crunchy crust and the soft, cheesy topping. </p>
 <ul>
  <li>slices of several-day-old bread</li>
  <li>Butter</li>
  <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
  <li>Pizza sauce</li>
  <li>Mozzarella</li>
  <li>pepperoni</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Now, follow these steps</h4>
 <ol>
  <li>Place six thick slices of bread on the baking pan, separating each piece a few inches apart</li>
  <li>generously butter both sides of each slice</li>
  <li>gently press the cheese down to secure it, then flip the bread cheese side down</li>
  <li>before adding on the cheese topping, youâ€™ll prebake the tomato-sauced slices (This will cause the sauce on top to caramelize slightly)</li>
  <li>Finally, load up each slice with fresh mozzarella, a few slices of pepperoni and your other favorite toppings. </li>
  <li>Bake until browned and melty</li>
  <li>Finally, enjoy your hot, extra-crispy piece of buttery pizza.</li>
</ol>
